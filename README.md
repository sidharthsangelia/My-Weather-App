Introduction
After learning web development, I took a break from it and lost touch with my skills. To regain my confidence and refresh my knowledge, I decided to create a simple yet functional weather app. This project has helped me dive back into web development, particularly focusing on JavaScript and CSS.

Project Overview
This Weather App allows users to search for weather information based on city names. It provides real-time data fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API, displaying essential weather details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon that represents the current weather condition.

Features
Search Functionality: Users can input a city name to fetch weather data.
Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive, ensuring a good user experience across devices.
Dynamic Weather Information: The app updates the displayed weather data without reloading the page, providing a smooth user experience.
Visual Feedback: Animations are included to transition between different states of the app, enhancing user interaction.

Technologies Used
HTML: For the basic structure of the app.
CSS: For styling the app and ensuring it looks appealing.
JavaScript: For fetching data from the OpenWeatherMap API and updating the DOM dynamically.

How It Works
User Input: The user enters a city name into the search box and clicks the search button.
API Call: The app sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the weather data for the specified city.
Data Display: Upon receiving the data, the app updates the weather information displayed on the screen, including the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a relevant weather icon.
Error Handling: If the city is not found, the app displays an appropriate message.

How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in your browser.
Enter a city name in the search box and click the search button to view the weather information.

Conclusion
This project has been a valuable learning experience, allowing me to revisit and strengthen my web development skills. I look forward to building more projects to further enhance my knowledge and confidence in this field.
